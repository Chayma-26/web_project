	<h1> The Best  Workouts You Can Do At Home</h1>
	<p>Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle—it provides multiple health benefits and is shown to have anti-aging effects. However, for many people finding the time to workout is a struggle. Busy work and home schedules continue to be the primary reason workouts are missed. Can you relate?

Luckily, exercise doesn't need to be all-or-nothing or a huge time commitment. Shorter, high-intensity workouts can provide a middle ground with a quick jolt of cardio and strength training that can really add up.

	<h1>7 Days of 7-Minute Workouts</h1>
	<p>7-minute workouts are a great way to exercise when your time is limited. The following workouts are fun, effective, and can be modified to your fitness level.</p>
	<h2>How to Use 7-Minute Workouts Effectively</h2>
	<p> As more and more time-strapped exercisers are turning to truncated exercise programs, the burning question is, do they work? While many of the social media claims, such as losing multiple inches and pounds per week with 7-minute workouts, are far-fetched, many people are finding significant success. The key is to keep expectations in line with reality.

While 7-minutes of exercise per day isn't going to turn you into an elite athlete, these workouts can help tone, build cardiovascular fitness, improve strength, and keep exercise momentum going between longer workouts. If those are your goals, then 7-minute workouts can produce effective results. Research has indicated that performing a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session lasting 7.5 minutes one time per week improved aerobic fitness.

﻿

Other studies have shown that high-intensity workouts can be as effective as longer, slower workouts in improving both aerobic and anaerobic capacity.However, researchers also noted that some participants did not prefer (or especially enjoy) day-after-day HIIT sessions, which require quick, explosive bursts of full-on, exhausting effort. This finding indicates it may be more effective for some people to alternative HIIT with other types of workouts, particularly for the long-haul. Either way, if you're looking for a quick, exercise boost on a busy day, a 7-minute workout is a great option.</p>

<!------------- Before Your Workout---------------->

	<h2 id="B">Before Your Workout</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Warm-up before exercising:</li>
		<p>Walk or jog in place and perform some light stretches for at least one minute before engaging in any workout routine.</p>
	<li>Pay attention to your form and function:</li>
	<p>Keep core engaged throughout the movements. Modify or discontinue any exercise that feels too difficult or causes discomfort.</p>
	<li>Use resistance based on your fitness level:</li>
	<p>For workouts that require dumbbells, beginners may want to start with 2 to 3 pounds and intermediate/advanced exercisers can start with 5 or 8 pounds or select a challenge resistance they're comfortable using.</p>
	<li>Pace yourself through the program: </li>
	<p>Reduce the time interval as needed. Modify plyometric exercises by eliminating the jump portion of the movement.</p>
	<li>Gradually increase duration :</li>
	<p>. As you practice these exercises and build your form, you can gradually increase the duration of the 30-second sets to 45-second sets for an extra challenge (in which case each workout would be over seven minutes).</p>
	<li>As you progress, consider adding multiple sets:</li>
	<p>For an added challenge, as time allows, work toward completing two or more 7-minute workouts in one session or spaced throughout the day.</p>
	</ol>
